</p>

The Citadel framework is a lightweight framework based on [`docker compose`](https://github.com/docker/compose).

It allows you to build your own docker-compose based apps with an update system, a way for containers to communicate with the host, a secure way to install apps and plugins and more.

### Included features

- Secure OTA updates via git repositories
- `karen`: An easy way for a container to execute scripts on the host.
- Secure app system with permissions
- Automatically assigned internal IP addresses (IP 4 and 6)

With the Citadel framework, you don't have to worry as much about security, architecture and other things. It just works.

### Projects using this

- [Citadel Core](https://github.com/runcitadel/core)
- [Citadel Server](https://github.com/runcitadel/core)
- [Citadel Lite](https://github.com/runcitadel/core)
